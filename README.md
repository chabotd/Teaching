The Nine Principles of UDI©
Universal Design for Instruction (UDI) is an approach to teaching that consists of the proactive design and use of
inclusive instructional strategies that benefit a broad range of learners including students with disabilities. The nine
Principles of UDI© provide a framework for college faculty to use when designing or revising instruction to be
responsive to diverse student learners and to minimize the need for "special" accommodations and retrofitted changes to
the learning environment. UDI operates on the premise that the planning and delivery of instruction, as well as the
evaluation of learning can incorporate inclusive attributes that embrace diversity in learners without compromising
academic standards.
Principle Definition
1. Equitable use Instruction is designed to be useful to and accessible by people with
diverse abilities. Provide the same means of use for all students;
identical whenever possible, equivalent when not.
2. Flexibility in use Instruction is designed to accommodate a wide range of individual
abilities. Provide choice in methods of use.
3. Simple and intuitive Instruction is designed in a straightforward and predictable manner,
regardless of the student's experience, knowledge, language skills, or
current concentration level. Eliminate unnecessary complexity
4. Perceptible information Instruction is designed so that necessary information is communicated
effectively to the student, regardless of ambient conditions or the
student's sensory abilities.
5. Tolerance for error Instruction anticipates variation in individual student learning pace and
prerequisite skills.
6. Low physical effort Instruction is designed to minimize nonessential physical effort in order
to allow maximum attention to learning.
Note: This principle does not apply when physical effort is integral to
essential requirements of a course.
7. Size and space for approach
and use
Instruction is designed with consideration for appropriate size and space
for approach, reach, manipulations, and use regardless of a student's
body size, posture, mobility, and communication needs.
8. A community of learners The instructional environment promotes interaction and communication
among students and between students and faculty.
9. Instructional climate Instruction is designed to be welcoming and inclusive. High expectations
are espoused for all students
